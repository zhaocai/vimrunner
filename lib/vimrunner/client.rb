    # Vim's usual remote-send functionality to send keys to a server does not

    # to more closely simulate user input.

    # Any keys are sent in a double-quoted string so that special keys such as
    # <CR> and <C-L> can be used. Note that, as per Vim documentation, such
    # keys should be preceded by a backslash, e.g. '\<CR>' for a carriage
    # return, '<CR>' will send those four characters separately.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   vim.command 'map <C-R> ihello'
    #   vim.feedkeys '\<C-R>'
